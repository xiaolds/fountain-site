                        <p className="description p16 ft16">
                            When T.Y. Fountain made our first fountain many years ago, it was
                            something spectacular, something that attracted people just to stand and
                            watch. By today’s standards, it was nothing special, it wasn’t even
                            illuminated at night, but still, it was something worth admiring. Next,
                            to this fountain, a passion took form, a hobby transitioned to a
                            profession and a brilliant history was just starting.

                            Skilled engineers, talented artists, and fountain technicians were added
                            exponentially throughout the years in the T.Y. Fountain family, and we
                            all share a rather twisted perception of water. We don’t see, taste or
                            sense water the way everybody else does. We see water as a medium to
                            create emotions.

                            This is what a fountain, actually is. A way to deeply involved with the
                            spectator through the most fundamental and fascinating substance on
                            earth. Every fountain has a unique character; it might convey
                            tranquility, it might be a work of art, it might trigger one’s
                            imagination through its perpetual liquid motion, or it can be a
                            mind-blowing extravaganza with massive volumes of water, impressive
                            light shows and even re, all dancing to music, following a dramatic
                            choreography. It can essentially be anything – anything that one can
                            imagine of. Our job is to turn extraordinary ideas into marvelous
                            fountains. T.Y. Fountain Canada have our proposals, but we can also turn
                            your idea into a liquid piece of art.
